	Akeeba LoginGuard is an implementation of real Two Step Verification for Joomla. Instead of asking the user to
	provide their two factor authentication secret key at login time we show a Two Step Verification page after the
	initial username / password authentication. This works just like Google, Facebook, Twitter, iCloud etc.
