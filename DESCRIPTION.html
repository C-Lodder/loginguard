	Akeeba LoginGuard is an implementation of real Two Factor Authentication for Joomla. Instead of askign the user to
	provide their two factor authentication secret key at login time we show a captive login page after the initial
	username / password authentication. This works just like Google, Facebook, Twitter, iCloud etc.
