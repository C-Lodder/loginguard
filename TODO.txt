Show a list of available TFA methods to the user if multiple are available. Remember to load the loginguard plugin group!

Implement showing a single TFA method's page to the user (w/ a link to change the method if multiple are present)

Create a plugin for the backup codes
Create a plugin for TOTP (Google Authenticator)
Create a plugin for YubiKey
Create a plugin for U2F
Create a plugin for code by email
Create a plugin for code by SMS

The front- and back-end controllers must make sure that the backup codes plugin is always activated and published LAST. If not, activate it and reload the page.

Frontend page to manage TFA methods for current user only
User plugin to let the user launch that page from his profile edit page

Backend page to manage TFA methods

Make sure you can't create front-end menu items to this component

Migration from core TFA plugins

Customizable module to notify users when they haven't enabled TFA yet
    Link to enabling TFA
    Show X times per session
    Stop showing message after a total of X times

Deal with plugins(?)
	I need to forcibly unload all loaded plugins in various stages
	I may have to inspect its _methods and _observers arrays
