Create a plugin for "Code by email"
    Works similar to TOTP with 120 second period and 10 digit passcodes
    If it's not already activated, send a code to the user's email address onLoginGuardTfaGetSetup
    If it's already activated, send a code to the user's email onLoginGuardTfaCaptive
    If the code validates store the secret key onLoginGuardTfaSaveSetup

Create a plugin for code by SMS
    It's TOTP delivered to a phone number
    See https://www.cmtelecom.com/pricing/sms
    If it's not already activated, send a code to the user's mobile phone onLoginGuardTfaGetSetup
        If no phone was entered, validate the phone.
        If validation fails throw an exception with the error
        Otherwise store the phone in the session
        Try to send a text
        If the text fails throw an exception with the error
        ** Tell the component to display the next message as an info message
        Return to the same page in the component
    If it's already activated, send a code to the user's mobile phone onLoginGuardTfaCaptive
    If the code validates store the mobile phone and secret key onLoginGuardTfaSaveSetup


The front- and back-end controllers must make sure that the backup codes plugin is always activated and published LAST. If not, activate it and reload the page.

Migration from core TFA plugins

Deal with plugins(?) in the captive page
	I need to forcibly unload all loaded plugins in various stages
	I may have to inspect its _methods and _observers arrays

Validation should be against a method, not a record
    Change the text about the method title: it's not shown during login, just when editing validation methods
    Selection page: select a method, not a record
    Validation page: display the method name, not the record information
    Validation and Selection page: pass around the method name, not the record
    Plugin: loop through all records of each method. If one of them works it's a valid log in
