# Akeeba LoginGuard

A real Two Step Verification system for Joomla!

## What does it do?

This solution adds a _Two Step Verification_ for Joomla! login. After logging in with just your name and password you are asked to provide your second step verification, e.g. a code generated by Google Authenticator. Until you provide a correct second step verification you will not be able to access any pages on the site. You will always be redirected to the "_captive login_" page. This is very much like what Google does when you try to login to GMail.
