## Release highlights
 
**First stable release :clap:**! We are excited to present you Akeeba LoginGuard, a unique Two Step Verification System for Joomla. 
 
For more information and documentation for administrators, users and developers please [consult the documentation Wiki](https://github.com/akeeba/loginguard/wiki).
 
## Joomla and PHP Compatibility

Akeeba LoginGuard is compatible with Joomla! 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7. It requires PHP 5.3.10 or later, the same minimum PHP version as Joomla! itself. It's also compatible with PHP 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 7.0 and 7.1.

We strongly recommend using the latest published Joomla! version and PHP 7.0 or 7.1 later _for optimal security of your site_. It makes no sense adding two step login verification to a site that's running vulnerable software. It's like locking your door and leaving your windows wide open. It will not keep the bad guys out.  

## Changelog

**New features**
* Two Step Verification for the front- and backend of your Joomla! site.
* Verification with Google Authenticator and compatible applications.
* Verification with YubiKey in OTP mode using the Yubico or custom validation servers.
* Verification with U2F hardware keys on Google Chrome (Linux, Windows, macOS, Android), Firefox (Linux, Windows, macOS) and Opera (Linux, Windows, macOS).
* Migrate settings from Joomla's Two Factor Authentication and our legacy Akeeba YubiKey Plugins for Joomla! Two Factor Authentication.
* Optional. Let your users manage their Two Step Verification settings from their user profile edit page.
* Optional. Automatically show a page where your users can set up Two Step Verification if they haven't done already (displays either the default page or a custom article).

**Other changes**
* Use the new U2F API 1.1
* Consistency of Confirm button appearing below the form, even in the backend.
* The plugins now put their data in the media folder, following Joomla's best practices. 

**Bug fixes**
* The submit button wasn't shown on the edit method page when using U2F.
* Try to notify when U2F is not supported by the browser instead of silently failing.
