## Release highlights

**CHANGEME**. CHANGEME.
 
## Joomla and PHP Compatibility

Akeeba LoginGuard is compatible with Joomla! 3.8 and 3.9.

Akeeba LoginGuard requires at least PHP 5.6. It's also compatible with PHP 7.0, 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3.

We strongly recommend using the latest published Joomla! version and PHP 7.2 or later _for optimal security of your site_.

**IMPORTANT!** Starting Summer 2019 we will drop support for all versions of PHP which are [officially considered End Of Life (EOL) by the PHP project](http://php.net/eol.php). EOL  versions of PHP _no longer receive security updates_ and MUST NOT be used on production sites.
