<h3>What's new</h3>
<p>
    Brand new component!
</p>

<h3>Joomla! 3.4 or later</h3>
<p>
    We only support Joomla! 3.4 or later, including 3.5. We strongly advise you to run the latest available version of
    Joomla! for security reasons. Older versions of Joomla! have known major security issues which are being actively
    exploited to hack sites.
</p>

<h3>PHP 5.3.10 or any later 5.x/7.x version is required</h3>
<p>
    We tentatively support PHP 5.3.10 and later - the same as Joomla's minimum requirements. Please note that PHP 5.3
    has been end of life since August 2014 and widely considered a security risk, unfit for production sites. We
    strongly recommend using the latest PHP 7.x version.
</p>
<p>
    We'd like to remind you that Joomla! 3.4 does NOT support PHP 7. PHP 7 is only supported by Joomla! 3.5.0 and
    later versions. If you are on Joomla! 3.4 we recommend that you use the latest version of PHP 5.6 and that you
    update to the latest version of Joomla! as soon as possible.
